Adding Functionality to BattleSim3000 to include 3 extra classes, saving functionality &amp; load functionality

Hi Gorge sorry for the delay. I have updates my base code for project 6. My codes should be pretty easier understandable and has a very good structure which would makes us easier to create a new character and update the "load"
function. But I am also open to your suggestion as well. 
Please let me know if you have any comments
